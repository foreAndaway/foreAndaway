- 👋 Hi, I’m @foreAndaway. I have no idea what that name means, I set this account up a while ago.


- 👀 I’m interested in all the things. I'm going to be putting up ideas and projects that I don't yet have the skills for.
Eventually as my skills and capabilities mature, I'll be able to nudge the projects slightly forward.
More than anything I'd really love if people could simply hone my research direction, so to speak.
When I post my intended projects and flesh out the components that comprise them, I'd love it if you all could offer
suggestions like "ooh! That part of the project is probably best handled by this language/site/whatever.
As an example, just off the top of my head, to solve the problem of PCB manufacture, my first google search would be JLB PCB,
only because I've heard them mentioned in the youtube channels I follow. For machine learning and AI model evaluation
and tweaking, the first search would be weights and biases.
Even if the suggestion is not the best solution for the component of the project I'm trying to bring to fruition, just being
aware of the other options out there, for some reason, is supremely helpful to my thought process.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning all the things. I tend to start very high level to get an overview of how things fit together,
the current state of the tools/processes that might solve my problem or make it elegant, and then hack together the
pieces of skills that I need to get a functional prototype going.


- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... whatever I can contribute to, in whatever way I can contribute. I'm a voracious
consumer of information and it's always shocking to see how things connect and how some focused expert missed something
a casual generalist stumbled upon. Eventually, I'd like to collaborate on the absolute cutting edge of whatever I'm
working on.


- 📫 How to reach me ... err.... I suppose through here for now. Haven't really set up an "online presence" or a streamlined
communication process yet. I still have to figure out how I want to interact with online collaboration, and in how
measured a dose. I'd like to do something like a discord for more live, instant feedback, I'd like to run some sort of
social media presence for more intermittent and spotty effort, and obviously email for more focused, one-off type stuff.
